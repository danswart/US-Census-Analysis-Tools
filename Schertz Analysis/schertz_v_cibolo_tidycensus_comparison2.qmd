Data Availability for Longitudinal Analysis:
Maximum Range Available:

ACS 5-Year Estimates: 2009-2022 (14 years!)
ACS 1-Year Estimates: 2005-2022 (but only for places 65,000+, so not applicable)
Decennial Census: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020 (different variable structures)
Population Estimates: 2000-2022 (limited to population data only)

Recommended for Small Cities (<65k): ACS 5-year estimates give you the maximum of 14 years (2009-2022)
Key Features of the New Code:
Step 1: User Sets Years First

# SET YOUR YEARS HERE - Customize at the top
ANALYSIS_YEARS <- 2009:2022  # Maximum range (14 years!)
# Or customize:
# ANALYSIS_YEARS <- 2015:2022  # Recent 8 years
# ANALYSIS_YEARS <- c(2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2022)  # Every 3 years

Built-in Data Availability Checker

Tests your years before running full analysis
Shows which years have data for your cities
Prevents wasted time on unavailable data

Flexible Rerun Function

# Quickly change years and re-run:
rerun_analysis(2015:2022)  # Recent 8 years
rerun_analysis(c(2009, 2015, 2022))  # Snapshot years
rerun_analysis(2010:2020)  # Exclude pandemic years

Rich Output Options

Excel workbook with separate sheets for each year
Trend analysis with compound annual growth rates
Current vs. historical comparisons
CSV exports for external analysis

Advantages Over Your Current Code:

More Years: 14 years vs. your current 5 years
User Control: Set years once at the top, everything else adapts
Data Validation: Checks availability before processing
Trend Analysis: Automatic growth rate calculations
Flexible Output: Year-by-year sheets plus trend summaries
Quick Iteration: Easy to test different year ranges

Bottom Line: You can get 14 years of detailed demographic, economic, and housing data (2009-2022) - nearly triple what most analyses use and far more informative for understanding long-term trends!
