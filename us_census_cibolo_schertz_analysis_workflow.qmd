## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic approach to analyzing longitudinal data for Cibolo, TX (78108) and Schertz, TX (78154) using US Census Bureau's built-in applications. Both cities are located in Guadalupe County, Texas, with populations under 60,000.

**Key Information:**
- Cibolo, TX: ZIP 78108, Guadalupe County
- Schertz, TX: ZIP 78154, Guadalupe County  
- Both cities are part of the San Antonio metropolitan area

## NOTE

Using tidycensus eliminates most of the manual downloading suggested in the workflow. Here's what changes:

What tidycensus Replaces:
✅ No need to manually download from data.census.gov:


All ACS data (DP02, DP03, DP04, DP05 tables)
Decennial Census data
Population estimates
Most demographic/economic/housing variables


✅ No CSV/Excel file management:

Data comes directly into R as clean data frames
No need to wrangle multiple downloaded files
Automatic variable labeling and geographic coding


What You Still Might Need Manual Downloads For:
❌ LEHD Applications (tidycensus doesn't cover these):


OnTheMap - Commuting patterns, workplace analysis
QWI Explorer - Quarterly workforce indicators
J2J Explorer - Job-to-job flows
These require using the web applications directly


❌ NHGIS Historical Data:

Time series with standardized boundaries (1790-present)
Historical tract boundary normalization
tidycensus goes back to ~2009 for ACS, 1990 for Decennial


❌ Specialized Surveys:

Business Dynamics Statistics
Some experimental datasets


Revised Workflow with tidycensus:
Phase 1-2: Demographics & Current Analysis → 100% tidycensus ✅
Phase 3: Workforce Analysis → Mostly manual web apps ❌
Phase 4: Historical Context → Mixed (tidycensus + NHGIS) ⚠️


Bottom Line:
For your Cibolo/Schertz analysis, tidycensus handles about 70-80% of the data collection automatically. You only need manual downloads if you want:

Detailed commuting/workforce flows (OnTheMap)

Pre-1990 historical comparisons (NHGIS)

Business establishment data


The demographic, economic, housing, and recent population trends can all be pulled directly into R - no manual downloading required!



## Phase 1: Current Demographics and Housing (data.census.gov)

### Step 1.1: Basic Demographics
**Tool:** [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/)

4. Download key tables:
   - **DP02**: Selected Social Characteristics
   - **DP03**: Selected Economic Characteristics  
   - **DP04**: Selected Housing Characteristics
   - **DP05**: ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates

5. Repeat process for "Schertz city, Texas"
6. Create comparison spreadsheet with both cities' current data

### Step 1.2: Historical ACS Comparisons
1. Use "Compare" feature in data.census.gov
2. Select multiple ACS 5-year periods (2013-2017, 2016-2020, 2018-2022)
3. Focus on:
   - Population growth trends

3. Generate reports for:
   - Where Cibolo residents work (destination analysis)
   - Industry breakdown of jobs
   - Earnings distribution
   - Age demographics of workforce

4. Select "Work Area" analysis  
5. Draw same boundary to analyze:
   - Where workers in Cibolo live (inflow analysis)
   - Compare residential vs. employment patterns

**Repeat for Schertz (ZIP 78154)**

6. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare commuting distances between cities
   - Identify economic specializations
   - Analyze dependency on San Antonio metro employment

### Step 2.3: Job Flow Analysis (J2J Explorer)  
**Tool:** [J2J Explorer](https://j2jexplorer.ces.census.gov/)

1. **County-Level Analysis** (Guadalupe County):
   - Track job-to-job flows over time
   - Focus on:
     - Job-to-job flow rates
     - Industry switching patterns
     - Earnings changes with job changes
     - Flow destinations (which counties/metros)

2. **Time Periods to Analyze:**
   - Pre-recession (2008-2010)
   - Recovery period (2011-2015)  
   - Recent growth (2016-present)

4. **Historical Context Document:** Long-term growth trajectory and development phases
5. **Comparative Analysis:** Positioning relative to regional peers

## Data Limitations and Considerations

- **Small Population Impact:** Some detailed breakdowns may not be available due to disclosure limitations
- **Geographic Aggregation:** Some analyses may require county-level data as proxy
- **Time Lag:** Most recent data typically 1-2 years behind current date
- **Survey Margins of Error:** ACS estimates for smaller areas have larger confidence intervals
- **Industry Classification Changes:** NAICS codes updated periodically, affecting historical comparisons
