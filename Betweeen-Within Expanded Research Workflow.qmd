Your strategic thinking about boundary testing is methodologically sound. Here's a systematic research expansion plan:

Tier 1: Core Robustness Tests (Highest Priority)

Income Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

Top 30%, 20%, 10% definitions of "successful"

Research Question: Does the within-group > between-group pattern strengthen as success criteria become more exclusive?

Hypothesis: Should see stronger effects (higher ratios) with more selective thresholds

Why Critical: Tests whether findings depend on arbitrary 40% cutoff



Income Distribution Segments

0-20% vs 20-40% (bottom vs lower-middle)
40-60% vs 60-80% (middle vs upper-middle)

Research Question: Is this pattern unique to high performers, or universal across income distribution?

Why Critical: Determines if findings generalize or only apply to economic elite


Family Structure Controls

Childless individuals only
Never-married only

Research Question: Do family composition differences drive the racial patterns?

Why Critical: Major potential confound that could explain everything



Tier 2: Variable Expansion (High Value)

PUMS Variables to Add

* WKHP (exact hours worked) - work intensity beyond binary full-time
* FOD1P/FOD2P (field of degree) - engineering vs humanities vs business
* Disability status - health as a factor
* Citizenship/nativity - immigrant vs native-born effects
* Language at home - assimilation measures
* Home ownership - wealth proxy



Alternative Success Metrics

* Wage income vs total household income - individual vs family effects
* Industry-adjusted income - tech vs education vs healthcare
* Educational field premiums - STEM vs other degree effects



Tier 3: Criticism-Proofing (Defensive Research)

"Selection Bias" Counters

* Age cohort breakdowns - Millennials vs Gen X vs Boomers
* Different geographic areas - urban vs suburban vs rural
* Migration timing - recent immigrants vs established families



"Historical Barriers" Counters

* Within-occupation analysis - same job, different races
* Educational institution controls - community college vs 4-year vs elite
* Generational effects - first vs second-generation patterns



"Measurement Issues" Counters

* Bootstrap confidence intervals for small sample groups
* Multiple imputation for missing data
* Sensitivity analysis for outlier removal


Anticipated Criticisms & Responses

"This Ignores Structural Racism"

* Counter: Test within identical occupation/education/age cells
* Counter: Show patterns consistent across cohorts (if structural barriers weakening, should see generational differences)



"Sample Selection Into Success"

* Counter: Show same patterns in middle-income ranges
* Counter: Historical analysis showing mobility patterns



"Geographic Concentration Effects"

* Counter: Replicate in multiple metropolitan areas
* Counter: Test rural vs urban vs suburban separately



"Wealth vs Income Differences"

* Counter: Use home ownership and vehicle ownership as wealth proxies
* Counter: Focus on wage income rather than household income



Research Design Strategy
Workflow Organization

*  Primary Analysis: Current framework with different income thresholds
*  Family Controls: Separate analyses for childless, never-married, etc.
*  Income Segments: Full distribution analysis
*  Variable Extensions: Adding occupation, education field, citizenship
*  Geographic Validation: Different metro areas or rural/urban splits



Statistical Considerations

-  Each analysis should report the within/between variation ratio
-  Focus on effect sizes rather than just significance
-  Use standardized metrics for cross-analysis comparison
-  Include confidence intervals for all ratio estimates



Potential Findings Hierarchy

* Strongest case: Pattern holds across all income levels, family structures, and becomes stronger with more selective success criteria

* Moderate case: Pattern exists but varies by family structure or income level
Weak case: Pattern only exists under specific conditions



Red Flags to Watch For

* Cohort effects suggesting historical rather than individual factors
* Disappearing effects when controlling for family structure
* Reversed patterns in lower income segments
* Large confidence intervals suggesting unstable estimates



This expansion plan would provide comprehensive evidence while anticipating the most likely methodological criticisms. The tier structure helps prioritize which analyses would be most valuable for strengthening your core argument versus which are defensive measures against potential criticism.
